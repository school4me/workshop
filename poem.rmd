I wandered lonely as a Cloud    
   That floats on high oâ€™er Vales and Hills,    
When all at once I saw a crowd,    
   A host of golden Daffodils;    
Beside the Lake, beneath the trees,    
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.    

Continuous as the stars that shine    
   And twinkle on the Milky Way,    
They stretched in never-ending line    
   Along the margin of a bay:    
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,    
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
