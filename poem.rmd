  She never got to dance  
Or go to her own prom.  
She never got the chance  
To forget where she came from.  
  
She never got to kiss,  
A man she idolized.  
She never felt love's bliss,  
'Cause she was paralyzed.  
  
She never got to talk  
About love with a smile.  
She never got to walk  
Down a church's aisle.  

She never got to say  
Those precious words, "I Do."  
But she was far and away  
The strongest girl I ever knew.
